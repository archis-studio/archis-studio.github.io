## Project Overview

Built a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights for decision-makers. The platform processes multiple data sources and presents real-time KPIs through interactive visualizations.

## Key Features

* **Real-time Data Processing**: Automated ETL pipeline with 5-minute refresh cycles
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs built with Plotly
* **Multi-source Integration**: Combines data from CRM, marketing platforms, and financial systems
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing
* **Export Capabilities**: PDF reports and CSV data downloads

## Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture
```python
# Example data processing pipeline
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def load_sales_data():
    # Connect to PostgreSQL database
    data = pd.read_sql(query, connection)
    return process_metrics(data)
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented caching strategies reducing load times by 75%
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Used async processing for data updates
