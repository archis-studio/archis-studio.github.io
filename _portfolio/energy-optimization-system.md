## Project Challenge

Industrial facility needed to optimize energy consumption across multiple buildings while maintaining operational efficiency. Manual monitoring resulted in 20-30% energy waste and high operational costs.

## Solution Architecture

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Predictive Modeling**: LSTM networks for energy demand forecasting
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time identification of equipment inefficiencies
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Multi-objective optimization for cost and performance

### IoT Integration
- **Sensor Network**: 200+ smart meters and environmental sensors
- **Data Collection**: MQTT protocol for real-time data streaming
- **Edge Computing**: Local processing to reduce latency

## Key Achievements

* **35% Cost Reduction**: Annual energy savings of $180,000
* **Predictive Accuracy**: 92% accuracy in demand forecasting
* **Response Time**: Automated adjustments within 30 seconds of anomaly detection
* **Sustainability Impact**: Reduced carbon footprint by 28%

## Technical Highlights

```python
# Energy demand prediction model
class EnergyDemandPredictor:
    def __init__(self, sequence_length=24):
        self.model = self.build_lstm_model()
        
    def build_lstm_model(self):
        model = Sequential([
            LSTM(50, return_sequences=True),
            Dropout(0.2),
            LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
            Dense(1)
        ])
        return model
```
